Hello! Thank you for checking out this project.

This has been an ever increasing project as I continue to work on it
but the main goal has always been the same: to create an offline resource
to use for your Pokemon adventure. What a full "offline" resource counts
as exactly has changed multiple times over the course of creating this.

Currently this includes:
  Weakness Calculator
  Breeding Matchup Table
  Stat Calculator

I have been working on this slowly, as it's definitely required a good bit
of learning and problem solving beyond what I knew to start. Namely how to
handle the offline requirement that I've set for myself. As it currently
stands there are a few more things I'd like to add hopefully in the near(ish)
future. 

Will Include:
  Generation Filters (At least start with Sword/Shield and going forward
    will debate going back farther. This will be implemented in the breeding
    matchups and stat calculator tabs)
    
  Stat Comparison Between Two Pokemon
  
  A Living Dex Tracker (This one will be a bit farther off as it's going
    to be a lot more involved than *just* a dex tracker)
    
This is a side project for me to practice and learn some new tricks, so progress
may get rather slow at times.
